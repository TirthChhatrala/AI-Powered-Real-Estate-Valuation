   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install flask scikit-learn pandas joblib flask-cors numpy
   ```

3. Add the dataset file `AmesHousing.csv` inside the backend folder.

4. Train the model:

   ```bash
   python model_training.py
   ```

5. Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

🔗 API runs at: `http://localhost:5000`
